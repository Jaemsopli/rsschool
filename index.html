<p>The purpose of my training is to acquire skills in the field of information technology with the prospect of obtaining a highly paid position. I want to be able to work remotely so that I can travel the world without breaking away from my work. I think this is important because there aren't many jobs in the world that allow us to be mobile.</p>
